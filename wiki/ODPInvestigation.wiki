=Investigation=
A scientific [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000747 investigation] is a [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000999 procedure] that aims to support, dispute or refute a well formulated [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000284 hypothesis] through the [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001051 analysis] of [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000089 data] obtained through  [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001055 observation] and/or [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001054 measurement]. Investigations _usually_ involve:

 * the development of a research [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000076 plan] which includes, but not limited to:
  * the formulation of a [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000284 hypothesis]
  * the formulation of aims and [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000337 objectives]
  * the formulation of a [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001041 study design]

 * the execution of the research plan which includes, but is not limited to: 
  * the [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001049 selection, preparation or collection] of [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001050 sample(s)]
  * the [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001052 collection of data] through [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001055 observation], [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001007 assay] or [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001054 measurement]
  * the [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001051 analysis] of [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000089 data]
  * the preparation of an investigational [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001026 report]

An investigation is related to its activity parts through [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000053 has proper part], and activities, being themselves processes, may be temporally ordered (occurs before / after) with [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000248 precedes]. 

[http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000136 Descriptions] [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000563 describe] or [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000332 provide information about] some [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000000 entity] ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/object object] or [http://semanticscience.org/resource/process process] or [http://semanticscience.org/resource/attribute attribute]). A [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000284 hypothesis] is a _proposed_ explanation (a description) of some phenomena, while an [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000337 objective] is a description of a _desired_ outcome. Descriptions that [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000338 specify] a set of actions to be executed are known as [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000091 effective specifications], which include [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000076 plans], [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001041 study designs] and [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001043 protocols]. A plan should clearly identify ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000338 specify]) one or more [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000337 objectives], and optionally specify a [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000284 hypothesis] or a [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001041 study design]. Plans, like other effective specifications, are [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000341 manifested] as processes. 

[http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000999 Procedures], such as [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000747 investigations], [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001007 assays] and [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001054 measurements] are [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000426 manifestations of] [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000091 effective specifications] (information content entities may be [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000341 manifested] as objects or processes, including [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000651 text], [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000605 sound], [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_001059 physical gestures], etc).  Thus, investigations (via the plan), have hypotheses and objectives as [http://semanticscience.org/resource/000008 attributes]. An objective [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000356 is realized in] the investigation _iff_ those outcomes are fully apparent. Data generated from the investigation may also serve as [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000773 evidence for] the hypothesis, and more specifically found to be [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000208 supporting], [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000209 disputing], or [http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000775 refuting].
