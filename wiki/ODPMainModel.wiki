= foundational model =
SIO follows a three-dimensional worldview which differentiates objects from processes: objects are entities that occupy space and are fully identifiable at any moment in time in which they exist, whereas any non-exactly overlapping temporal interval of a process only identifies some part of the process.  

While all SIO entities _exist at_ and are _located in_ some space and time, these are not necessarily real space or real time, but may instead occur in a hypothetical (propositional), virtual (electronic), or fictional (creative work) setting.  These and other qualities (intrinsic attributes) or realizable entities such as capabilities (action specifications) and roles (behaviors, rights and obligations) exist concurrently with the entity that bears them. 

In order to indicate when a capability or role plays a part in some process, SIO specifies that the capability or role is realized in that process. Thus, it becomes possible to delineate the set of actions that an entity makes without having to specifically enumerate them. Another significant SIO design pattern is that information about an entity is treated as an attribute of the entity, and literal values such as strings, numbers (integer, float, double), booleans and dates, of these attributes are directly captured using SIOâ€™s sole datatype property - sio:has-value.
