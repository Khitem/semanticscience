#summary Ontology Design Pattern: Measurements
#labels SIO,ODP

Measurements are at the core of science. The following specifies which types and relations can be used to express quantities and their units. 

Quantities have specific values that should be specified using the 'has value' datatype property and the value restricted to xsd:double, xsd:float and xsd:integer. Units can be specified using the [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize/45500 unit ontology] with the 'has unit' object property. Quantities are the result of a measurement process, and as such can also be time indexed to a time instant or time interval (which itself is an object that specified as an xsd:dateTime). Finally, quantities are an attribute of the entity that was measured.

{{{
'quantity'
subClassOf
 'has value' some Literal
  and 'has unit' only 'measurement unit'
  and 'measured at' some ('time instant' or 'time interval' and 'has value' some xsd:dateTime)
  and 'is output of' only 'measurement process'
  and 'is attribute of' some 'entity'
}}}

Thus, entities can be described in terms of their quantified attributes as follows:
{{{
'entity' 
subClassOf
  'has attribute' some (
    'quantity' 
    that 'has value' some Literal
    and 'has unit' some 'measurement unit'
   )
}}}


Finally, we can represent the generation of a quantity as follows:
{{{
'measuring process'
subClassOf 
 'process' 
 and 'has agent' some ('has function' some 'to measure')
 and 'has target' some ('has disposition' some 'to be measured')
 and 'has output' some 'quantity'
 and 'has attribute' some ('time interval')
 and 'conforms to' some 'effective specification'
}}}
