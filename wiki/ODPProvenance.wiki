#summary Ontology Design Pattern: Provenance
#sidebar SIOSideBar
=Provenance=
Provenance refers to the chronology of an object, including the circumstances around its origin (creation/discovery) and subsequent transfer of ownership or derivation.

A [http://www.w3.org/2011/01/prov-wg-charter W3C working group] was formed to provide a specification for the representation of provenance in RDF/OWL.  The proposed model involves 3 types (Entity, Activity and Agent) and 7 relations (!WasDerivedFrom, !WasGeneratedBy, !WasAssociatedWith, !WasAttributedTo, !WasInformedBy, Used and !ActedOnBehalfOf). The main use cases that are presented include: Generation, Usage, Communication, Invalidation, Derivation, Revision, Quotation and Influence. Let us consider these in the context of SIO.

===Process-Based Provenance===
*Creation* ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/creation sio:creation]) is the process by which an entity comes into existence, *destruction* ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/Destruction sio:destruction]) is the process by which an entity ceases to exist, and *modification* ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/modification sio:modification]) is the process by which an entity is modified (gains/loses parts, qualities, roles, dispositions, functions, etc) but _retains_ its identity. 

Processes can be described in terms of their participants in the following way:
  * 'has participant' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-participant sio:has-participant]) specifies entities that _participate_ in a process
  * 'has agent' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-agent sio:has-agent]) specifies entities that direct or actively participate in the creation/modification/destruction/use of an object

  * 'has input' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-input sio:has-input]) specifies entities _used_ in a process
  * 'has target' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-target sio:has-target] specifies entities that are _modified_, but retain their identity 
  * 'has substrate' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-substrate sio:has-substrate]) specifies entities that are _consumed_ (or are sufficiently changed that they lose their canonical identity)
  * 'has product' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-product sio:has-product]) specifies _new_ entities formed by the process

Process space and time can be specified by:
  * 'is located in' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/is-located-in sio:is-located in]) specifies the space of processes
  * 'exists at' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/exists-at sio:exists-at]) specifies the time instant (exact xsd:dateTime) or interval of processes (datatype range to specify the start and end date and times e.g. >= dateTime && <= dateTime). 

===Object-Level Provenance===
SIO offers several relations to specify the provenance relationship _among_ objects. In the first case, we consider objects that were created by, is being provided by or have been obtained from a source.

  * 'has source' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-source sio:has-source]) specifies _an_ origin of the object
  * 'has creator' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-creator sio:has-creator]) specifies the agent responsible for bringing the object into existence
  * 'has provider' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/has-provider sio:has-provider]) specifies the agent that provided the object
  * 'derives from' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/derives-from sio:derives-from]) specifies the object(s) from which this object was created from/with

_informational objects_

  * 'is version of' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/is-version-of sio:is-version-of]) specifies the object for which this is based on
  * 'is prior version of' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/is-prior-version-of sio:is-prior-version-of]) / 'is subsequent version of' ([http://semanticscience.org/resource/is-subsequent-version-of sio:is-subsequent-version-of]) specifies the version order
