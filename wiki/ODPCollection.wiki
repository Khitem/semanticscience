#summary Ontology Design Pattern - Collections

Collections are useful to associate arbitrary entities together. Collections are defined in SIO as :

http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000616

A collection is a set for which there exists at least one member, although any member need not to exist at any point in the collection's existence.

Collections are related to members of the collection through the 'has member' relation 

http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000059


If a collection contains only one kind of member, then we can write a class axiom like
{{{
'Collection of x valued items'
 equivalentClass
 'collection'
 and 'has member' some ('x' and 'has value' some Literal)
}}}
If a collection consists of values that must be paired together, we can write:
{{{
'Collection of xy-valued-pairs'
 equivalentClass 
   'collection' 
   and 'has member' some ('xy-pair' 
      and 'has component part' some ('x' and 'has value' some Literal)
      and 'has component part' some ('y' and 'has value' some Literal)
   )
}}}

example instantiation:
{{{
:cxy a 'collection' ;
  'has member' [ a 'xypair'; 
      'has component part' [ a 'x'; 'has value' 1^^xsd:int] ;
      'has component part' [ a 'y'; 'has value' 2^^xsd:int] ;
   ] .
}}}
