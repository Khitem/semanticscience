In order to generate high quality ontologies, we advocate the following ontology design principles:

== Agile Design ==
Ontology design should be _simple_, _sustainable_ and _highly effective_.  While some ontologies are being designed to comprehensively capture knowledge in a particular domain, others are far simpler and significantly more pragmatic. In all cases, ontology design should be clearly motivated by use cases thereby enabling rapid and focused development, continual evaluation, and regular milestone releases. 

We encourage both a collaborative and competitive ontology design practice. Ontologies may be designed by individuals or small groups, and published as working drafts with open calls for participation towards improvement and consensus. Where ontologies may not or cannot satisfy certain use cases, or artistic differences preclude effective collaboration, designers should feel free to make derivative or alternative works to address these deficiencies and demonstrate their utility. Good ideas should inform existing ontologies or the ontologies risk losing their relevance. 


== Basic Design Principles ==
The following set of basic principles must be followed by any Semantic Science ontology.
 # The ontology *must* be represented and correctly adhere to the strict semantics of the [http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/OWL_Working_Group Web Ontology Language (OWL)].
 # All ontologies *must* be licensed with [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ Creative Commons - Attribution]. This ensures that people are free to share and create derivative works with the sole condition that derivative works *must* acknowledge sources.
 # Resources, whether ontologies or entities described within them, *must* be uniquely and persistently identified by International Resource Identifiers ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt IRI]). These *should* be [http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/ dereferenceable].  OWL documents *should* be [http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-owl2-syntax-20090421/#Ontology_Documents versioned]. The IRI syntax is suggested to follow that of the [http://bio2rdf.wiki.sourceforge.net/Banff+Manifesto Banff Manifesto].
 # Resources *should* be described with brief English labels (rdfs:label) and human readable definitions (dc:description) that are as accurate as possible, while not adding superfluous information or imposing unnecessary constraints. For consistency, labels should be lower case (unless a formal name) and words separated by whitespace. More elaborate syntax rules can be found [http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/Naming here].
 # Resources *should* be (to the extent possible) described through axioms that match their human readable descriptions. 
 # The scope of the ontology *should* be clearly described and *must* be motivated by itemized requirements (e.g. use cases), for each it will be expected to satisfy. These requirements *may* be documented on a public document such as a web page, a white paper, or a published work.


== Linked Knowledge ==
Integrating diverse knowledge is an ambitious endeavor with difficult challenges. Even  representing the same kind of knowledge from different data providers is hard. By providing the Minimum Information for Linked Knowledge (MILK), data providers can quickly generate linked data that can be published into and discovered through the Semantic Science knowledge network. Yet linked data is not sufficient for mining our collective knowledge and answering questions across the set of related resources due to irregular representation of data. We must strive towards unified representations, with data models that can check semantic consistency. This will facilitate the publication of structured knowledge on the emerging semantic web that is both accurate in the details and precise in the representation.

 * Where possible, ontologies *should* map ontology terms to entities and relations defined in the [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/visualize SIO@Bioportal ].
