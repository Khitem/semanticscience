#summary Ontology Design Pattern - Change
#sidebar SIOSideBar


= Change =
There are many criterion for maintaining the identity of objects through time, of which [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.7618&rep=rep1&type=pdf Ontoclean] is the most coherent, and philosophically agnostic.


We can represent the process of change as follows:
{{{
‘enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation using ATP’
‘addition reaction’
and ‘has target’ some ‘protein’
and ‘has target’ some ‘ATP’
and ‘has agent’ some ‘phospho-enzyme’
and ‘has product’ some ‘phosphorylated protein’
and ‘has product’ some ‘ADP’
}}}

this implies that the protein is converted into a new molecular entity hence, we could make the instance-level assertion that

'protein' 'derives into' 'phosphorylated protein'
and
'ATP' 'derives into' 'ADP'
